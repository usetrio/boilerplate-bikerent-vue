# Bike Rental Boilerplate - VueJS

![VueJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/vue-3.2.41-green?style=flat-square) ![Options API](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Options%20API-yellowgreen?style=flat-square) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-blue?style=flat-square)

This project was created for the Trio Challenge, where candidates must create a functional system to rent bikes.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

# Project Requeriments

* `node` >= v16
* `npm` >= 8

Case environment does not match requirements, it is recommended to use `nvm` to handle different node environments. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Additionally, a `.nvmrc` file was added to set correct `node` environment to run application.

```sh
nvm use
```

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

For development of new tests, use instead:

```sh
npm run test:unit:dev
```

Unit tests rely on snapshots, case component html is changed, it will need to updated them:

```
npm run test:unit:snapshots
```

**Note:** snapshots should be added to commits as well.

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
